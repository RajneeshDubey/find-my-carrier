 * React hook for storing the focused element when a component mounts then returning the focus to that component when the component unmounts.

 * const MyComponent = () => {

 * @param {array} conditions — An array containing variables that when changed will rerun the effect.
 * @param {boolean} disable —  When true, will prevent focus from returning to the previously focused element.
 * @returns {void}
